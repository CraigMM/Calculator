## Aim:
The aim of this project is to create a simple calculator program in C that allows the user to input an operator and two operands, and then performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) based on the chosen operator.

## Abstract:
This project is a simple console-based calculator program written in C. It prompts the user to input an operator (such as +, -, *, /) and two numerical operands. Based on the operator entered, the program performs the appropriate arithmetic operation and displays the result. It also handles errors by displaying a message if the user inputs an invalid operator. The program demonstrates the use of conditional statements (switch-case), basic input/output handling, and data types such as char and double.

## Core Points:
Operator Input: The program accepts one character operator from the user (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Operand Input: The user is prompted to enter two numeric operands for the operation.
Switch-Case Structure: A switch statement is used to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation based on the operator entered.
Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid operator, the program outputs an error message.
Arithmetic Operations: The program supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Objectives:
To understand the use of switch statements for decision-making in C.
To practice working with different data types (such as char and double) in C.
To implement basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
To handle basic error checking (invalid operator input).
To demonstrate console input and output handling in C.
